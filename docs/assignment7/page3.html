        <p class="lead mb-4">Stadium Piece, like all art, takes time to understand its "purpose" or "use" to each person. Which is why you were required to document your first time with the piece. How long did you take? What did you notice?

        "Stairs of Nowhere" was created with various interpretation in mind. It is not to be viewed, but rather to view out of. The experience comes from the height dynamic it provides the viewer. From the crevice
        in the middle of the stairs, it acts as a cradle that "protects" you from the otherwise open field. However, from the peaks of the stairs, it acts as a watchtower giving the viewer a sense of freedom and "control" of the land they can see. From my experience, my first encounter with it was of confusion and comedy. There was no rhyme or reason that stairs that lead back to ground level in the middle of an open field was useful or artistic. It was only when I spent more time and physically interacted with it, that I began to appreciate its existence.
        <br>

        Your goal on the next page is to spend atleast twice your original time to extract some "purpose" from the sculpture.
