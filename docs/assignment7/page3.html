        <p class="lead mb-4">Stadium Piece, like all art, takes time to understand its "purpose" or "use" to each person. Which is why you were required to document your first time with the piece. How long did you take? What did you notice? 
        <br>
        <br>
        From my experience, I believe the given name "Stairs to Nowhere" reflects the sculpture's purpose. Rather than admiring it like the Mona Lisa from afar, people are actually supposed to ride the sculpture. As Nauman stated, the function of the piece changes as the environment changes.
        <br>
        <br>
        Your goal on the next page is to spend atleast twice your original time to extract some "purpose" from the sculpture.
