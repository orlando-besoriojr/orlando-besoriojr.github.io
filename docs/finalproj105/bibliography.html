                        In this paper, the Wikimedia Foundation gives an open view on the state of knowledge gaps in their database, mainly divided into three categories, Content, Contributors, and Readers. Disenfranchisement, the complexity of race, along with the need for culture/region-specific context have led to an overall under-representation of POC on Wikidata.

                        This paper by Teresa Correa and Sun Ho Jeong delves into how different races approach online content creation and their many nuances. One of my largest takeaways are the authors' observations of  “three main principles regarding participation [organizing discourse] among minority groups on the internet.” These are Connecting, Enacting the self, and Struggling. Niche communities, self-expression, uncontrolled content, and many more make up the discourse people of color tend to participate in.

He mentions that the query tool and database of Wikidata could act like a magnifier to “identify areas of improvement.” In the article, Kent calls for more communities to participate and take advantage of Wikimedia's openness to improve representation.

                        This paper covers how race correlates to internet usage, its causes, and the overarching digital divide created by it. The paper concludes that the digital divide is caused by socioeconomic inequality affecting people of colors’ ability to access the internet. The purpose for internet usage between different races, however, remained the same as they were all able to communicate, access information and entertainment at relatively the same level.

                        Andre Brock's paper primarily focuses on the state of Black identity compared from the real world to the online space. They define the internet as a “third space” that provides a space for people to break free from the confines of the real world and be who they want to be. The discursive nature of the internet is an important tool used to empower/present racial identities when in the real world, systemic bias and racism cloud incredibly important perspectives. “Third places serve a regenerative function for the people who frequent their environs; where they can reconstitute themselves as 'people' apart from their kinship and work networks.”

                        One of the biggest takeaways from this article I have found is Jessie Daniels referring to the inherent “whiteness” of the internet. A long-term societal “white racial frame” had been established allowing for a continuation of unbalanced power structures to replicate itself from the real world on to the internet. As Daniels says, this leaves “the burden of noticing race” up to researchers who are people of color. This denial of racism and the belief that we are living in a color-blind web is more often than not reinforcing discrimination and intolerance.
