                        The internet has always been a space for data to move freely, shapeshifting from website to website. However at times, searching for exact information can become an ordeal with conflicts in data arising from site to site. Wikidata, a project funded by the Wikimedia Foundation in San Francisco, has become one of many websites that have begun to curate and give structure to this vast amount of information in an effort to provide ease of accessibility to data. The way they have gone about their goal is by encouraging open-collaboration with any person and machine. It has proven to be successful, however there still exists a problem that must be addressed. Many of the stereotyping and division found in American society have found their way into Wikidata. These can be observed through Stuart Hall's theory of the Spectacle of the Other.

                        Misrepresentation of black/white, asian/white, and its other derivatives have left many people of color to their own devices in the digital space. They either used the internet to validate their identities or have conformed to the standards upheld by the normative majority. These observations have been repeated time and time again from the digital divide of the early Internet, to the early 2000s popularity of personal blogs, and even to today's important social media place. The next logical step is to analyze these effects in the increasingly relevant machine-based, and data-driven repositories to ensure that the level of misinformation present on our personal interactions with the internet does not spread on larger scales.

                        Data is a driving force in our society. The education and insights it provides has and will continue to be central in how we make decisions. However, biased and misinformed data can set us back twice as far. My project will uncover the extent of Hall's theory present on Wikidata, how it affects the online space, and why it is (one of) the first steps towards a structured data future.

                    <h3>
                        What is the Spectacle of the Other?
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        The Spectacle of the Other is a theory of representation that analyzes the tendency for society to create binary oppositions to find meaning. These dichotomies are tools that had "captured the diversity of the world" (Hall, 235), but at the same time reduce complexity. Meaning is supposed to be a created through dialogue between two parties and that those differences are the meaning to be captured. What happens, though, is that the 'other' is reduced to the differences they have with the 'normal' group (typically extremes) that exclude them from the rest of society. As Hall writes, it "engages feelings, attitudes and emotions and it mobilizes fears and anxiety in the viewer" (Hall, 226). These reactions materialize into misrepresentation and misunderstandings, all of which perpetuate power inequalities. This effect is especially true in the context of race, a social construct with differences that regularly change and require a dialogue to understand fully. Hall has proposed three solutions to contest the affects of 'otherness' in terms of racialized representations. The first is reversing the stereotypes. However, Hall argues that this is just escaping one stereotype and into another. The second strategy is to substitute the popular, negative imagery of racialized others with more positive ones. A problem Hall argues is that while this increases the range and complexity of representation, it does not necessarily get rid of the longstanding negative imagery. People will continue to use the negative imagery as frames of meaning. The final suggestion is to accept that meaning, and thus representation, is never final and always changing. By doing so, rather than bringing new perspectives by reversing and substituting stereotypes, you use the stereotypes that are already a part of that body of representation and make people see its flaws. All these come together as a theory of what and how to tackle representation in our society.

                        Racism v. Whiteness Graph
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        A major component when understanding Stuart Hall's Spectacle of the Other theory, is to identify two oppositions. I decided to start on a large scale and analyze the connections Wikidata has not made between whiteness and racism. In this graph, we found that in the relationship between whiteness and racism, there are no tangible connections to be found. Constructing meaning from these two items in Hall's theory would mean that whiteness is just a simple case of white privilege, when we know this is not the case. Whiteness and racism are inextricably tied to long socio-historical roots. Especially knowing that Wikidata is based in the United States and has a predominantly North American community, it is impossible to ignore this misstep. Even a simple connection from whiteness to racism cannot be found, much less the actual aspects of whiteness such as microaggressions, racial color blindness, and normalization. We have put such a heavy focus on the 'other' (racism and its victims) that a topic that is equally salient to understanding race has been left out. In this binary and through Hall's definition, both racism and whiteness do not have any real meaning.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This, I believe is a limitation I could see to Hall's theory. While race and racism is multi-faceted with it being central to topics of social inequality, discrimination, prejudice and more, the definition of whiteness relies solely on its relationship with race and racism. In a real world case, there would be dialogue between whiteness and race however the example shown in Wikidata shows a potential constraint. The inability for things to have fixed meaning means that the self is never in charge of its own meaning. Hall mentions how British people cannot determine what being British is. Rather, it is their interactions with the 'other' that defines it. British customs and tradition cannot be included as they do not involve the 'other.' The same goes when you apply the theory to whiteness and racism on Wikidata. How could we say that whiteness simply cannot exist because someone has not created dialogue and connections between the two concepts?

                    <p>
                        In this example, I took the most recent influential and controversial cases of police brutality and graphed the volume of information found on each of their respective pages. The blue nodes represent the cops and the nodes tied to them, while the yellow nodes represent the victims and the nodes tied to them as well. At this surface level observation, we can already see disparities crop up in terms of representation. Despite both the victims and the aggressors being complex individuals with their own motivations and history, one is more heavily scrutinized than the other. There is a visible inclination to differentiate George Floyd (for better or for worse) and alienate him while Derek Chauvin is allowed to exist in obscurity far from the level of critique and exaggeration that their counterpart experiences.

                        In this graph, we can see the points of conflict each party's item faced. All the edits made have been reverted, but looking at this allows us to explore the aspect of dialogue in Hall's theory. Despite what the graph shows, George Floyd's page has gotten more vandalism done to his page. There are two known instances that the page had to be locked. From Hall's theory, this is the emotional response that these dichotomies contribute to. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another study called Race and Online Content Creation, provides an explanation as to where these emotional responses could come from. In Race and Online Content Creation, the researchers observed that minority groups, specifically people of color, were more likely to participate in discourse on the internet. People of color (the “other”) were compelled to be active content creators as a way to have agency in the identities formed around them online. In our example, heavily documenting George Floyd's life strengthened the communities and identities of the people associated with him. This avenue of self-expression gave them control to formulate their own identity, but at the same time it had the effect of alienating them into enemies. Trolls, sympathizers of Derek Chauvin, and the system that supports their beliefs (the normative party) become reactive and emotional as seen in the regressive amounts and types of vandalism done on George Floyd's page.
