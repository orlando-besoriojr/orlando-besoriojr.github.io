                        For my project, I decided to dive into the data graphs for victims of police violence, with a focus on George Floyd and Derek Chauvin. George Floyd was a victim of police brutality and was asphyxiated to death by Derek Chauvin on May 25th, 2020. His tragic death spawned protests across the United States of America and opened dialogue across a range of topics such as police brutality and racial tensions between Black and white people. The other cases I will be examining are of Breonna Taylor's and Trayvon Martin's.

                        General Graph of Police v. Victim

                    <p>
                        A major component when understanding Stuart Hall's Spectacle of the Other theory, is to identify two binary oppositions. In my example, I took three of the most influential and controversial cases of police brutality and graphed the volume of information found on each of their respective pages. The blue nodes represent the cops and the nodes tied to them, while the yellow nodes represent the victims and the nodes tied to them as well. At this surface level observation, we can already see disparities crop up in terms of representation. Despite both the victims and the aggressors being complex individuals with their own motivations and history, one is more heavily scrutinized than the other. There is a visible inclination to differentiate the victims (for better or for worse) and alienate them while the policemen are allowed to exist in obscurity far from the level of critique and exaggeration that their counterpart experiences.
