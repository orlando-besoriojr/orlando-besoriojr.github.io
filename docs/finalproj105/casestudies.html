                    <p>
                        A major component when understanding Stuart Hall's Spectacle of the Other theory, is to identify two oppositions. I decided to start on a large scale and analyze the connections Wikidata has or has not made between whiteness and racism. In this graph, we found that despite the known relationship between whiteness and racism, there are no tangible connections to be found. Wikidata is based in the United States and has a predominantly North American community, so the long socio-historical development of whiteness in modern society is impossible to ignore when discussing race and racism.

                    <p>
                        In this example, I took the most recent influential and controversial cases of police brutality and graphed the volume of information found on each of their respective pages. The blue nodes represent the cops and the nodes tied to them, while the yellow nodes represent the victims and the nodes tied to them as well. At this surface level observation, we can already see disparities crop up in terms of representation. Despite both the victims and the aggressors being complex individuals with their own motivations and history, one is more heavily scrutinized than the other. There is a visible inclination to differentiate George Floyd (for better or for worse) and alienate him while Derek Chauvin is allowed to exist in obscurity far from the level of critique and exaggeration that their counterpart experiences.

                        Vandalism Graph of George Floyd v. Derek Chauvin

                        In this graph, we can see the points of conflict each party's item faced. All the edits made have been reverted, but looking at this allows us to explore the aspect of dialogue in Hall's theory. Despite what the graph shows, George Floyd's page has gotten more vandalism done to his page. There are two known instances that the page had to be locked. From Hall's theory, this is the emotional response that these dichotomies contribute to. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another study called Race and Online Content Creation, provides an explanation as to where these emotional responses could come from. In Race and Online Content Creation, the researchers observed that minority groups, specifically people of color, were more likely to participate in discourse on the internet. People of color (the “other”) were compelled to be active content creators as a way to have agency in the identities formed around them online. In our example, heavily documenting George Floyd's life strengthened the communities and identities of the people associated with him. This avenue of self-expression gave them control to formulate their own identity, but at the same time it had the effect of alienating them into enemies. Trolls, sympathizers of Derek Chauvin, and the system that supports their beliefs (the normative party) become reactive and emotional as seen in the regressive amounts and types of vandalism done on George Floyd's page.
