                        Sources
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        For sources, my search began by finding information based on three different levels of specificity/precision. At first, I searched on the Western Washington University Libraries for topics surrounding racism in America. Then, I narrowed my search to specifically talk about articles about the discourse surrounding race in the online space. Finally, I searched for articles pertaining to race made by or about Wikidata itself. This way, I was able to single out a topic to analyze Wikidata with. As the project evolved, my narrative began deviating from the topics I initially found and I became more interested in Stuart Hall's theory, the Spectacle of the Other. (NOT DONE)

                    <h3>
                        Processing
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Processing the data I found was only possible through graphs. The nature of Wikidata is that of machine readability and so the only way to process any relevant information I found was through a node graph.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Other than the data nodes themselves, I originally also wanted to include some textual analysis of the discourse around the case studies I chose. What I found was that a lot of the history of an item and the discussion around it was not on Wikidata, but rather on its sister website, Wikipedia. There is very little information in terms of why certain edits were changed, reverted, removed, and created. This is most likely in part because by the time data has been transferred from other Wikimedia projects to Wikidata, the information has already been somewhat formalized on those websites. This situation, along with its relative obscurity in the public domain, made it difficult to find points of contention within even the most controversial entries of Wikidata.

                        Presentation
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Gathering the data was simple, but presenting the data proved to be difficult. The problems from the previous sections cascaded onto the presentation level where now I have information and abstractions on other topics that I have to re-interpret and find connections to my final topic. Other than that, creating the website was easy as the Bootstrap/Web Design tutorial and the free templates online gave me an easy way to structure all my text and images.
